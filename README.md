# SoundControl
C# Project for controling Windows' Sound & Record Devices.

This project is a conversion and extension of the "SetDefaultAudioEndpoint" project (originally written in VB).
Original work available here: http://sdae.codeplex.com/ (copy rights and original comments remained untouched where possible)

## Usage

The MultiPurposeTools was intended to be used for more than just changing default audio devices but I was too lazy.

The recommended way to use this is by setting up a media keyboard key and running the program with argument: `-p"SWITCH_TO_NEXT"`
e.g: `"C:\SoundControl\MultiPurposeTools.exe" -p"SWITCH_TO_NEXT"`

When changing to a new device, a baloon tip will appear with the name of the new device
